# TensorFlow Serving + Flutter

This folder contains the codelabs for the News-Source-Verification Project of the Run-Am.

The folder is organized as:
 - `codelab1` contains the first codelab code to train a News-Source-Verification model
 - `codelab2` contains the second codelab code to connect Flutter frontend to TensorFlow Serving backend

## Set up your Flutter development environment
For Flutter development, you need two pieces of software to complete this lab â€”the [Flutter SDK](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) and an [editor](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/editor).

You can run the codelab using any of these devices:

- The [iOS simulator](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/macos#set-up-the-ios-simulator) (requires installing Xcode tools).
- The [Android Emulator](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/macos#set-up-the-android-emulator) (requires setup in Android Studio).
- A browser (Chrome is required for debugging).
- As a [Windows](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/windows#windows-setup), [Linux](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/linux#linux-setup), or [macOS](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/macos#macos-setup) desktop application. You must develop on the platform where you plan to deploy. So, if you want to develop a Windows desktop app, you must develop on Windows to access the appropriate build chain. There are operating system-specific requirements that are covered in detail on https://docs.flutter.dev/desktop.
